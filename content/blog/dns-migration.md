Hello,
i've changed the location of this website from [www.pages.jereileu.ch](/blog/dns-migration) to [www.jereileu.ch](/). The old DNS records were deleted so the website under [www.pages.jereileu.ch](/blog/dns-migration) is no longer accessible. This migration was made possible by adding a secondary ip address to [my gitlab server](https://git.jereileu.ch) and enabling custom domains.
